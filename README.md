# Aircraft-Predictive-Maintenance

## Overview: 
Predicts aircraft engine failures within specific cycles using historical sensor data. Utilizes RNN architectures, including LSTM and Bi-Directional RNN, for proactive maintenance.

## Key Features:
### Data Preprocessing:
Cleans and prepares data for modeling.
### Model Development: 
Implements Simple RNN, Bi-Directional RNN, and LSTM models.
### Prediction:
Forecasts engine failures to optimize maintenance schedules.
### Technologies:
Python, Keras/TensorFlow, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
