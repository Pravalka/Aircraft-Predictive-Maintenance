# Aircraft-Predictive-Maintenance

Overview: Predicts aircraft engine failures within specific cycles using historical sensor data. Utilizes RNN architectures, including LSTM and Bi-Directional RNN, for proactive maintenance.

Key Features:
Data Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares data for modeling.
Model Development: Implements Simple RNN, Bi-Directional RNN, and LSTM models.
Prediction: Forecasts engine failures to optimize maintenance schedules.
Technologies: Python, Keras/TensorFlow, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
